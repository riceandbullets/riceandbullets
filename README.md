When it comes to Lao Tsu, Diogenes, Cicero, Cardano, Nietzsche, Jung, Ginsberg, or Thompson let's try our best to listen and learn. It is through careful study of their trial and error that we may hope to avoid the same experiences which drove some to the very edge of the proverbial void and over it for others. Few ever think as much as those listed above, but let us not forget they did not live their lives to the fullest, most remembered posthumously did not.

People have a tendency to either externalize or internalize what is most important to communicate. The constant connectivity granted by the information age seems, in some ways, to have had a paradoxical effect on our ability to communicate with each other. We could look back to a time before language had fully developed and before the homo-genus had more than one remaining species in it; I imagine we would still see those animals making art for the sake of art alone. When I can't find meaning in Etymology I will try limit myself to only the visual, because if it's what we see alone, it is most likely as abstracted as it could ever be. I find some of the best practices in life to avoid unnecessary stress or confusion and enjoy the aesthetics of it all while continuing to do so.
